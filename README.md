## Google Data Analytics Capstone - Case Study 01 - Cyclistic

## Introduction

This case study is part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, Course 8: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/home/week/2). The goal of this course is to complete a case study by putting into practice all that has been learned in the previous courses, and to present the results of said case study to future potential employers. For this case study, I will perform an analysis of the data for the fictional company "Cyclistic", and attempt to answer the question **"How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"**. I will also present a report for each of the data analysis steps. The data used was provided by the course and can be accessed [here](https://www.coursera.org/api/rest/v1/asset/download/pdf/1XKhm37HS9iPXHfAIEBaRQ?pageStart=&pageEnd=)
